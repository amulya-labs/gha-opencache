name: S3 Cache with MinIO
# Example: Using MinIO S3-compatible storage backend
#
# S3 storage works on BOTH GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners.
# Benefits over actions/cache:
# - Custom storage backend (actions/cache only supports GitHub's cache service)
# - Cache shared across multiple runners
# - Full control over retention, storage location, and costs
# - Works with self-hosted MinIO, AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, etc.
#
# Runner options:
# 1. Self-hosted (shown below): Most common for MinIO (local infrastructure)
# 2. GitHub-hosted: Change to "runs-on: ubuntu-latest" if MinIO is publicly accessible
#
