name: S3 Cache with Cloudflare R2
# Example: Using Cloudflare R2 S3-compatible storage
#
# Cloudflare R2 works on BOTH GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners.
# Benefits over actions/cache:
# - Custom storage backend (actions/cache only supports GitHub's cache service)
# - Low-cost storage with zero egress fees
# - Cache shared across multiple runners
# - Full control over retention and costs
#
# Runner options:
# 1. GitHub-hosted (shown below): Common for cloud storage like R2
# 2. Self-hosted: Change to "runs-on: self-hosted" if using self-hosted infrastructure
#
