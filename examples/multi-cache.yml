name: Multiple Caches
# Example: Using multiple independent caches in one workflow
#
# Storage options:
# 1. Local filesystem (shown below):
#    - Requires: self-hosted runners with persistent disk
#    - Fastest, no external dependencies
#    - Each cache stored independently at /srv/gha-cache
#
# 2. S3/GCS backends (see s3-*.yml, gcs-*.yml):
#    - Works on: GitHub-hosted OR self-hosted runners
#    - Custom storage backend (actions/cache doesn't support this)
#    - Shared cache across multiple runners
