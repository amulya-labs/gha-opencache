name: Multiple Caches
# Example: Using multiple independent caches in one workflow
#
# This action is designed for SELF-HOSTED RUNNERS with local filesystem cache.
# Each cache is stored independently on the runner's disk at /srv/gha-cache/v1.
#
# For GitHub-hosted runners, use actions/cache instead.
# Docs: https://github.com/amulya-labs/gha-opencache#examples
